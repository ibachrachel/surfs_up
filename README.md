### Module 9: Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Overview

*Background: W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.* 

*Purpose: In order to convince the invester, W. Avy, it's necessary to present data that will demonstrate that the weather will be agreeable for this line of business. If W. Avy is convinced of the impending successfulness of the business, it could be expansion to all of the Hawaiian islands, not just Oahu. By retrieving the data from the SQLite file, the Oahu temperatures for the months of June and December can be analyzed using summary statistics. Noting the differences between these two datasets will help develop the analyses further and reveal what aspects need to be further explored.* 

# Results

To further analyze if it's a smart and worthy venure to establish a Surf 'n Ice Cream Shop in Oahu, it's important to compare how the weather will be affected by the changing seasons. Three things that are pretty important to explore is the minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and the mean temperature. Comparing the two statistics tables that were generated for June and December, these can be easily compared. Due to the tropical location of Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands, it seems that the temperatures do not very as much as they do on the Mainland. 

- The maximum temperatures are very similar: with June's max being 85 and December's being 83.  

- June's minimum temp. is 64 and December's minimum is 56. This statistic shows more of a difference, so we can now examine the mean. 

- The means compare similarly to the maximums: with June's at 75 and December's at 71.

# Summary 

These findings will definitely influence the investor's decision because the temperature statistics indicate that a Surf 'n Ice Cream business could succeed in both the Summer,as well as the Winter. An additional way to look at the summary statistics is to compare the standard deviations. On the Mainland, the temperature flucuates dramatically in the Winter, but in Oahu the standard deviation is 3 for both seaons. This means that the temperature does not spread very far apart. This is promising to the investor because it means that sales could be steady throughout the year. Warmer weather is a good indicator of people being willing to go out and spend money.

This simple analysis is not complete though. To truly do your due diligence before diving into this business, it's important to analyze components that might affect business. The year round temperature should be analyzed to ensure that each month has the possibility of having warm days with lower amounts of precipitations. Due to the tropical location, precipitation is a factor that needs to be factored in. Higher levels of precipitation might indicate smaller crowds on the beaches. The June and December data is promising, but adding these two queries to the mix might help built the claim that this is a worthy mission to embark on.
